               <br /><br />Jimmy Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), better known by his online alias MrBeast, is an American YouTuber, Internet personality, businessman, and philanthropist.[6] He has been credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that centers on expensive stunts.[7]

                Donaldson began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 at the age of 13,[8] under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers."[9] He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[9] Over time, his style of content diversified to include challenge and donation videos that reward thousands of dollars, videos with arduous tasks or survival challenges, and original vlogs.[10] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired several of his childhood friends to help him run the growing brand. As of 2020, the MrBeast team was made up of 30 people.[11]

                Donaldson's main YouTube channel, which had more than 90 million subscribers in February 2022,[12][13][14] is called "MrBeast".[A] He also runs several other YouTube channels, including Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast Shorts, and a philanthropy channel. [15][16] He was also one of the top 10 highest-paid YouTubers of 2020, alongside other personalities such as Markiplier, Ryan's World and Blippi.[17] He is also the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables, and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million,[18][19] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[20].</p>
